ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.

              -                                

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* PUtteruserver\
* PhUtteruerver\app.yaml
* Utteru.uirver\cron.yaml
* PhonUtteruver\dashboard.py
* PhoneUtteruer\index.yaml
* Phone9Utterur\model\
* Phone91Utteru\model\datastore.py
* Phone91_Utterustatic\
* Phone91_sUtterutatic\css\
* Phone91_seUtteruatic\css\main.css
* Phone91_serUtterutic\img\
* Phone91_servUtteruic\img\default_avatar.gif
* Phone91_serveUtteruates\
* Phone91_serverUtterutes\contacts.html
* Phone91_server\Utterues\edit_avatar.html
* Phone91_server\tUtterus\simple_form.html
* Phone91_server\web_services.py
* tests\
* tests\src\
* tests\src\com\
* tests\src\com\example\
* tests\src\com\example\android\
* tests\src\com\example\android\samplesync\
* tests\src\com\example\android\samplesync\AllTests.java
* tests\src\com\example\android\samplesync\authenticator\
* tests\src\com\example\android\samplesync\authenticator\AuthenticatorActivityTest.java
* tests\src\com\example\android\samplesync\client\
* tests\src\com\example\android\samplesync\client\UserTest.java

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
